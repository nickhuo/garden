τ -bench: A Benchmark for T ool-Agent-User
Interaction in Real-World Domains

Abstract
Existing benchmarks do not test language agents on their interaction with human
users or ability to follow domain-specific rules, both of which are vital for deploying
them in real world applications. We propose τ-bench, a benchmark emulating
dynamic conversations between a user (simulated by language models) and a
language agent provided with domain-specific API tools and policy guidelines.
We employ an efficient and faithful evaluation process that compares the database
state at the end of a conversation with the annotated goal state. We also propose
a new metric (pass^k) to evaluate the reliability of agent behavior over multiple
trials. Our experiments show that even state-of-the-art function calling agents (like
gpt-4o) succeed on < 50% of the tasks, and are quite inconsistent (pass^8 < 25%
in retail). Our findings point to the need for methods that can improve the ability
of agents to act consistently and follow rules reliably.
1 Introduction
There is increasing excitement around the potential of language agents [20, 24, 18, 1] to enable new
levels of automation across various industries. However, their deployment in real-world systems
requires several key desiderata to be satisfied. Agents must (1) interact seamlessly with both humans
and programmatic APIs over long horizons to incrementally gather information and resolve intents,
(2) accurately adhere to complex policies and rules specific to a task or domain, and (3) maintain
consistency and reliability at scale, across millions of interactions. For instance, consider the case of
an airline booking agent (Figure 1). When a user wants to change their flight reservation to a different
destination airport, the agent needs to gather the required information by interacting with the user,
check the airline policies using the guidelines provided, and find new flights and (if possible) rebook
the user using complex reservation APIs. In addition, the agent should be consistent in its behavior
across different kinds of users with the same request, and robust to small changes in the conversation
flow that should not affect the end outcome.
Modeling realistic human interaction and rule following in agent evaluation is vital for developing
and deploying trustworthy agents in the wild, and tackling challenges like long-context reasoning
and planning in a methodical fashion. Existing benchmarks [27, 29, 12, 14, 16] for language agents
often feature simplified instruction-following setups, where the agent autonomously interacts with an
environment (web, code terminal, or APIs) given all the information upfront, without any human-in-
the-loop interaction and without the need to consult any domain-specific guidelines.
In this work, we introduce τ-bench (short for Tool-Agent-User Interaction Benchmark) to measure
an agent’s ability to interact with (simulated) human users and programmatic APIs while following
domain-specific policies in a consistent manner. τ-bench is built in a modular framework with
(1) realistic databases and APIs, (2) domain-specific policy documents, and (3) instructions for

diverse user scenarios and corresponding ground truth annotations. As a first demonstration, we
focus on the realm of customer service and create two different domains where agents need to assist
simulated users with diverse requests (τ -retail and τ -airline). We leverage the generative capabilities
of language models (LMs) for data creation and realistic human user simulation [15] in conjunction
with manual annotation and verification.
We constructed τ-bench in three stages, including manual schema and API design, LM-assisted
generation of data entries, and manual scenario generation and verification for the user simulator.
Our evaluation scheme compares the database state at the end of each episode with the ground truth
expected state. This allows for objective measurement of the agent’s decision making, while also
providing room for stochastic variation in the conversation itself, since the user may pose the same
request in different ways that result in the same end state of the database. We also introduce the
metric of pass^k, which measures the consistency and robustness of the agent across k i.i.d. trials.
Our experiments reveal that agents built with simple LM constructs (like function calling or ReAct)
perform poorly, highlighting the need for more sophisticated agent architectures. For instance, even
state-of-the-art LMs like gpt-4o achieve low task success rates (pass^1) using function calling
(∼61% on τ-retail and ∼35% on τ-airline). With increasing k, the chance of consistently solving a
task drops rapidly, to as low as ∼25% for pass^8 on τ-retail for the same model. This showcases
the fragile nature of such agents in handling stochasticity and partial information, which is common
in human-agent interaction. Upon analyzing the failure cases, we find that current agents struggle
with complex reasoning over databases, understanding and following ad-hoc policies, and handling
compound (more than one) requests. We hope that τ-bench enables the evaluation and development
of more consistent and capable agents for real-world digital tasks involving human interaction.
2 Related Work
Most existing benchmarks for agents and task-oriented dialogue systems focus on evaluating either
conversational or tool-use capabilities. τ-bench aims to unify both under realistic settings, while also
testing how well agents can follow domain-specific policies in a consistent manner.
Benchmarks for language agents and tool use. Several benchmarks have been developed to
evaluate agents powered by LMs [27, 29, 12, 14, 16] . Recent efforts have focused specifically on
evaluating tool use capabilities of LMs, i.e., their ability to generate the right function calls from a
set of functions in an API. Projects like the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) [ 23],
2

--- PAGE 3 ---

ToolBench [22] and MetaTool [11] test tool use/function calling in multiple programming languages
and propose various methods for evaluating the accuracy of function calls. ToolEmu [ 16] uses
language models themselves to emulate the execution of tools, with a focus on exposing potential
safety risks when LM agents fail to use tools correctly. However, all these works only contain a
single-step user interaction, where the human interacting with the agent provides an initial instruction
containing all the required information. In contrast, our benchmark focuses on a more realistic setting
where the agent has to interact with human users to gather information and authorization.
Task-oriented dialogue. Task-oriented dialogue has been a long-standing challenge for NLP, with
several efforts over the years to build domain-specific offline datasets or user simulators. The former
types of benchmarks are static and only test the conversational agent on pre-collected conversation
trajectories[4, 3, 2]. The latter either rely on user simulators that are rule-based or rely on symbolic
specifications [ 17, 8] or perform tests with real humans through crowdsourcing platforms [9]. Some
very recent work explores the use of LMs as response raters to train dialogue systems [10] or evaluates
their capability for simulating users [7]. τ-bench leverages the powerful text generation capabilities
of state-of-the-art LMs to simulate realistic user utterances and long-context conversations using
textual scenario descriptions, with the goal of evaluating agents. The stochastic sampling from LMs
allows for diverse yet faithful variations in the dialogue when re-run with the exact scenario – this is
extremely useful for testing agent consistency, as we show in § 5.1.
User simulation with LMs. Our work is also related to recent efforts on using LMs as simulators
of human characters. This includes papers on simulating non-player characters (NPCs) in text
adventure games [13] multiple agents in human-like societies [15] or specific collaborative tasks [21],
and enabling human-in-the-loop interaction for tasks like online shopping [ 6] or web search [28].
However, all these past works have not used such simulators to benchmark the reliability of agents,
instead focusing on showcasing the ability of LMs to enable realistic simulations. Our work uses
such realistic user simulation to provide an accurate assessment of the reliability and robustness of
AI agents for deployment in systems that undertake millions of real-world interactions with humans.
3 τ -bench: A benchmark for T ool-Agent-User Interaction
Each individual task in τ-bench can be formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process
(POMDP) (S, A, O, T , R, U ) with state space S, action space A, observation space O, transition
function T : S × A → S × O , reward function R : S → [0, 1], and instruction space U. The agent
interacts with both (1) databases (db) via API tools, and (2) a (simulated) user (user) to complete a
task, i.e., S = Sdb ⊗ Suser, A = Adb ∪ Auser, O = Odb ∪ Ouser. In addition, the agent is provided a
domain-specific policy document containing rules it must adhere to – one can think of this as partially
describing the world model of the domain. We describe each component in more detail below.
Databases and APIs. Each τ-bench domain has several databases and associated APIs. The
contents of the database form the state sdb (Figure 2a), which is hidden from the agent and the
user, and can only be read from or written to using API actions adb, which are usually in the
form tool_name(**kwargs). When an action is executed on the database, the transition Tdb :
(sdb, adb) 7→ (s′
db, odb) is deterministic and implemented as a Python function (Figure 2b).
Domain policy. Each domain has a policy (Figure 2c) that explains the domain databases, task proce-
dures, and restrictions for the agent to follow in its interactions. Some restrictions are implemented
as checks in the API, e.g., using a payment ID not in the user profile will lead to odb = "Error:
payment not found" , and others not, e.g., the airline policy states different baggage allowances for
different membership statuses and cabin classes, but the agent needs to fill in the number of baggage
items to be paid for in the book_reservation API, similar to the freedom given real-world agents.
User simulation. We use a language model (gpt-4-0613) to simulate a human user interacting with
the agent. The user state suser consists of an initial system prompt with the task instruction (Figure 2d)
along with the entire conversation history between the user and the agent so far. The user cannot see the
interaction history between the agent and API tools. The agent can interact with the user using any nat-
ural language message, e.g., auser can be "Your reservation has been updated, is there
anything else I can help with?" . The transition Tuser : ( suser, auser) 7→ (s′
user, ouser) is
stochastic and attaches the agent’s message to the chat history followed by sampling a new user mes-
sage from the LM, e.g., ouser can then be "Yes, I also want to cancel another flight."
When the user issues ouser="###STOP###", the episode finishes and the agent is evaluated.

(d) User instruction ensures only one possible outcome.
Figure 2: τ-bench is constructed in a modular fashion with several components: (a) JSON databases,
(b) Python API tools, (c) Markdown domain policies, and (d) JSON task instances. The agent can
only access API tools and domain policies, and indirectly access databases via API tools. Task
annotation is not visible to the agent and is used only for user simulation and evaluation.
Task instances. As shown in Figure 2d, each τ-bench task instance has two parts: an instruction
for the user simulation (hidden from agents), and an annotation of the ground truth database write
actions (and optionally, ground truth outputs for user questions). The instruction sets up user identity,
intent, and preferences in a way that guarantees only one possible outcome under the domain policy.
Each task episode consists of the simulated user starting with a request, which the agent handles in
a conversational manner while being able to call tools at any point and refer to the provided policy.
Once the episode ends, the database state and agent-to-user messages are used to compute the reward.
Reward. The reward of a task episode r = raction × routput ∈ {0, 1} is based on (1) whether the final
database is identical to the unique ground truth outcome database (raction), and (2) whether the agent’s
responses to the user contain all necessary information (routput). So for the task of Figure 2d, the agent-
user dialogue can be varied and the agent can call various (read) actions, but the agent is successful
if the only database write action is return_delivered_order_items(order_id="#W2890441",
item_ids=["2366567022"], payment_method_id="credit_card_1061405") , and the user
responses contain "54.04", "41.64" as substrings. Note that r = 1 might be a necessary but not
sufficient condition for a successful episode e.g., the agent might issue the return without explicit
user confirmation, which violates the policy. Nevertheless, our proposed rule-based reward is fast to
compute and faithful, and already poses significant challenges for current models and methods as we
show in § 5.
Pass^k metric. For tasks like code generation with good verification techniques (unit tests), the
community has defined the pass@k (pass at k) metric as the chance that at least one out ofk i.i.d. task
trials is successful, which captures the trend of agents enabling discovery of solutions with scaling
of inference-time compute [5]. For real-world agent tasks requiring reliability and consistency like
customer service, we propose a new metric – pass^k (pass hat k), defined as the chance that all k
i.i.d. task trials are successful, averaged across tasks. Therefore, if a task is run for n trials and c of

In our case, for the same task, the user prompt and database transitions are the same, with just the
LM sampling of the user and agent messages generating sufficient stochasticity. Thus, pass^k can
capture the reliability of the agent at handling variations in conversations with the same underlying
semantics while adhering to the domain policies and rules. By default, we report the average reward
across tasks, pass^1=pass@1=E[r] = E[c/n], as the main metric for comparing agents.
4 Benchmark Construction
τ-bench defines domain-agnostic environment and user simulation classes shared by various domains,
and domain-specific data in terms of database JSON files, database API Python code and documenta-
tion, domain policy text, and task instances. Each domain is created in a three-stage approach with a
mix of LM and code runs, and human labeling and checking.
Stage I: Manual design of database schema, APIs, and policies. We start by co-designing the
simplest possible database schemas, APIs, and policies with inspiration (and simplification) from their
real-world counterparts. Simplicity is important for the logical consistency of various components
and the ease of API and task annotation. Still, a minimally realistic domain requires at least tens of
schemas, APIs, rules, and turns out to be challenging enough for existing agents. See § B.1 for more.
Stage II: Automatic data generation with LMs. Once the data schema is set up, we create an
example entry and use gpt-4 to generate a systematic code snippet to sample scalable entries, and
manually polish minor bugs in the code. See § B.2 for an example snippet and more details.
Stage III: Manual task annotation and validation with agent runs. Here, the key challenge is
to ensure the user instruction leads to a unique database outcome. For example, if the preferred
payment method is not specified, the user might answer differently and cause the final database to be
different across trials. So we write an initial user instruction, run a trial with gpt-4-turbo function
calling agent, polish the user instruction by examining the trajectory, and do this iteratively until
we are certain no ambiguities exist (see Figure 7 in § A, where we run each τ-retail task with > 40
gpt-4-turbo trials and check all tasks with zero or low success rates). We can copy and edit agent
actions and outputs for ground truth annotation, which is easier than annotating from scratch.
In practice, we might update minor details of database schemas or policies during data or task creation,
but the three stages are mostly linear, and the constructed data is organized in a modular structure.
4.1 Domains
Using the above procedures, we modularly construct two domains, τ-retail and τ-airline. We choose
these two domains as they are relatively easy to synthesize data (e.g., products, prices, flights) and
craft policies (e.g., product return, baggage allowance) based on common sense, allow for diverse
tasks, and are close to real-world applications. For more capable agents in the future, more advanced
domains (e.g., medical, tax, or legal) with more complex data and rules can be studied. Below, we
briefly describe the domain policies of two domains (full details of the domains in § B.1).
τ -retail. In this domain, the agent is tasked with helping users cancel or modify pending orders,
return or exchange delivered orders, modify user addresses, or provide information. Each product
(e.g., “Water Bottle” in Figure 2a) has various item options with unique IDs (e.g., 1000ml, stainless
steel, blue). Each pending order can only be canceled or modified once, and each delivered order can
only be returned or exchanged once. An item cannot be modified or exchanged for another product
5

type. These constraints simplify task and API design, and challenge agents to follow domain-specific
rules, and inform and collect complete information from users before taking actions.
τ -airline. Here, the agent has to help users book, modify, or cancel flight reservations, or provide
refunds. We construct 300 flights between 20 US cities with realistic durations and prices, and
API tools to query direct or one-stop flights. The domain policy is more complex than τ-retail,
with ad-hoc constraints about combining payment methods, checked bag allowance, flight changes
and cancellations, etc. These constraints can also be over membership tier and cabin class specific,
creating challenging multi-hop reasoning puzzles for the agent.
4.2 Key Characteristics
Realistic dialogue and tool use. Compared to prior task-oriented dialogue benchmarks, τ-bench
has more complex databases and realistic user simulations thanks to the advances of LMs. Some
trajectories can be seen in § C.2 and § D.2. Notably, even if the user instruction is synthetic, the user
utterances generated via LMs are open-ended and natural-sounding.
Open-ended and diverse tasks. Each τ-bench domain’s data schemas, APIs, and rules are simplified
compared to real-world domains, but they are rich enough to support the creation of extremely diverse,
open-ended, and sometimes creative tasks (see § A, § C.2, § D.2). Importantly, we trade off quantity
for quality — as § 5 shows, running a small set of high-quality tasks for multiple trials (with pass^k
metric) can reliably reveal rich insights into different models, methods, and research challenges.
Faithful rule-based evaluation. Real-world agents are hard to evaluate as the trajectory can be
extremely diverse for the same task, and success criteria are multi-faceted. As a result, it often requires
human evaluation, e.g., end users to judge task resolution and domain experts to judge rule following.
In τ-bench, we trade off slow, careful task annotation for fast, faithful evaluation. By ensuring that
only one database outcome is possible based on domain policies and user desires, subjective and
noisy human judgments can be replaced by simple and objective database state comparisons.
Modular extension. The codebase structure of τ-bench is modular, and it is easy to add new
domains to τ-bench, or add or update database entries, domain functionalities, rules, APIs, tasks, and
evaluation metrics (given they are consistent with the existing domain data). We release our codebase
publicly to encourage the community to create new tasks and domains for τ-bench.
5 Experiments
Models. We test various state-of-the-art proprietary and open language models for agents
through their APIs: OpenAI GPT API ( gpt-4o, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-4-32k, gpt-3.5-turbo),
Anthropic Claude API (claude-3-opus, claude-3-sonnet, claude-3-haiku), Google Gemini
API ( gemini-1.5-pro-latest, gemini-1.5-flash-latest), Mistral API ( mistral-large,
open-mixtral-8x22b), AnyScale API (meta-llama-3-70B-instruct). Only the last two mod-
els openly release weights. We do not test small models (7/13B) due to the difficulty of the benchmark.
Methods. Our main method for building the agent is through the use of function calling (FC), which
is natively supported by all tested LMs except Llama-3. In FC mode, the model’s system prompt
is set to be the domain policy, and at each turn, the model autonomously decides to generate a user
response message or a tool call. We also test text-formatted ReAct [ 26] and its Act-only ablation,
where the model is instructed to zero-shot generate “Thought: {some reasoning} Action: {some
JSON format action argument}” or only the action part. Notably, some agent methods are not suitable
for a user-in-the-loop setup, e.g., self-reflection [19] is unrealistic as real-world agents only have one
chance to serve the user, and planning approaches [25] might be too slow to help a user in real time.
We limit each task to at most 30 agent actions (either tool calls or user responses). For main results
(Table 2), we run at least 3 trials per task. The LM temperature is 0.0 for agent and 1.0 for user.
5.1 Main results
Model comparison. From Table 2, we see that gpt-4o is the best model with function calling,
and there is a wide spectrum of performances among various models. Notably, SoTA open-weight
models (llama-3-70b and mistral-8x22b) still have a significant gap to cover with respect to SoTA

proprietary models (gpt-4o, claude-3-opus). All models are still far from solving τ-bench, especially
the more challenging τ-airlinewhere even gpt-4o solves only 35.2% of the tasks. The diversity of
model performances (shown in Table 2) and task difficulties (shown in Figure 7 in § A) as well as
large remaining gaps from perfect resolution makes τ-bench ideal for benchmarking and developing
new models for agents, tool use, and dialogue.
Method comparison. Figure 3 shows that natively supported function calling consistently out-
performs text-formatted agent methods with the state-of-the-art models. For text-formatted agent
methods, adding reasoning traces still consistently helps (compare ReAct vs. Act columns) as
it helps bridge the gap between observations and actions that have unfamiliar formats. We have
also experimented with adding a “think” function for function-calling agents, but it did not boost
performance, perhaps because most FC models have not been trained toward such reasoning.
Agent consistency via pass^k. As shown in Figure 4, the chance of reliably and consistently solving
the same task multiple times significantly drops as the number of trials k increases. Even for the
best-performing gpt-4o function calling agent which has a > 60% average task success, pass^8 drops
to < 25%. In real-world scenarios, it is important and challenging not just to build agents with high
average success (pass^1), but with more robustness and consistency (pass^k trend).
Cost analysis. When we pair gpt-4o FC agent with gpt-4 user simulation on τ-retail, the agent /
user simulation costs are $0.38 / $0.23 per task respectively, so running one trial per task costs around
200 dollars. For the agent, the input prompt / completion output take up 95.9% / 4.1% of the price
respectively, so the cost is mainly due to long system prompt (domain policy + function definitions).
5.2 Research challenge analysis
In this subsection, we analyze in both quantitative and qualitative terms the challenges of τ-bench,
with a focus on the τ-retail split and the most advanced baseline: gpt-4o function calling agent.

Failure breakdown. We sample 115 gpt-4o FC agent tra-
jectories in τ-retail (1 trial per task), out of which 40 tasks
have failed (pass^1=65.2%). Upon manual examination
of these failures, 4 of them are caused by user instruction
typo or ambiguity (and then fixed), and the remaining 36
failure cases are agent issues, which are broken down into
more detail below and in Figure 5.

“wrong argument”, gpt-4o FC agent usually makes the
right type of tool call(s) but fills in one or more arguments
incorrectly. In the example shown in § C.2.2, the user
7

--- PAGE 8 ---

wants to exchange a lamp for a less bright one and prefers
an AC adapter over battery or USB power source. The agent fails to reason over the complex inventory
of lamps and find the unique option given such a preference. Weaker models and methods struggle
with even more basic failures such as hallucinating arguments — for example, while gpt-4o FC
agent only makes 0.46 tool calls with non-existent user/product/order/item IDs per τ-retail task,
gpt-3.5-turbo FC / Act agents make 2.08 / 6.34, respectively.
For “wrong info”, agents omit user-required information (e.g., the user asks for a tracking ID but the
agent does not provide it), or calculate the wrong information (e.g., wrong total price), or provide the
user with incorrect information that causes the user request to diverge (e.g., the user might cancel or
exchange based on incorrect price information provided by the agent). These failures account for
˜55% of overall failures and highlight the need for improved common sense and numerical reasoning
over complex databases and user intents for future models.
Failure 2: Incorrect decision-making: the challenge of domain understanding and rule following.
While the above failures can be recognized even without referring to the domain policy, “wrong
decision-making” failures (25% of overall failures) occur as the agent fails to understand the domain-
specific knowledge or rules and makes the wrong type of tool call. In the example of § C.2.1, the user
wants to exchange “a couple of items”, and according to the domain policy, “Exchange or modify
order tools can only be called once. Be sure that all items to be exchanged are collected into a list
before making the tool call”. However, the gpt-4o FC agent omits the domain knowledge and rule
and decides to exchange one item first, resulting in the second item not being exchanged.
τ-retail τ-airline
gpt-4o 61.2 → 56.8 33.2 → 10.8
gpt-3.5 20.0 → 14.5 10.8 → 9.6
Table 3: pass^1 scores degrade when
the domain policy is not provided in the
agent’s system prompt.
To further understand how different agents follow rules in
different domains, we perform an ablation study by remov-
ing the domain policy from the FC agent system prompt.
As seen in Table 3, in τ-retail where rules are simpler and
closer to commonsense, gpt-4o and gpt-3.5-turbo
agents only degrade 4.4% and 5.5% in terms of pass^1,
suggesting that their successful cases mostly stem from
using tools in an intuitive and common sense way, and that
they may not actually be leveraging the policy documents
to the extent possible. In τ-airline where rules are more complex and ad-hoc (e.g., baggage allowance
varies for different membership tiers and cabins), removing the policy hurts gpt-4o significantly
(−22.4%) but gpt-3.5-turbo only slightly (−1.2%), suggesting the former follows rules at times
but the latter does not has the capacity to process complex airline rules. Overall, τ-bench poses
significant challenges for function calling agents to follow complex domain dynamics and rules, and
showcases there is still work to be done in this direction. Domain-specific fine-tuning or agent code
scaffolding might provide some remedy, which can be important future work.

Failure 3: Partial resolution of compound requests. Lastly, as
shown in Figure 6, when a task involves many user requests (rep-
resented by the number of ground truth write actions to databases),
it becomes more challenging for function calling agents (19% of
cases). Sometimes the agent omits explicit user requests at the
beginning of the conservation, hinting at the need for better long-
context and memory capabilities. Other times, the agent omits
implicit actions, such as in § C.2.3, where the user wants to fix
wrong addresses in all orders, but the agent stops after checking
only one order. Agents need to improve in their consistency and
systematicity in handling such cases.
6 Discussion
We have presented τ-bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating the reliability of agents in interacting
with humans and tools in dynamic and realistic settings. The benchmark leverages the latest advances
in LMs to simulate users, allows for automated testing of agents and provides an assessment of an
agent’s ability to follow domain-specific rules in a consistent manner. Our results show that even
SOTA LMs are far from being reliable for use in real-world settings.

Directions for improvement. While τ-bench is a step towards dynamic evaluation of agents in
real-world scenarios, there are several directions for improvement. The simulated user can have
some limitations: (1) the user instruction might contain typos or ambiguities, which annotators can
examine and fix; (2) the user instruction may not contain all domain knowledge, e.g., in § C.2.1,
the user authorizes the single item exchange without knowing that the agent could only issue one
exchange action, which reflects real-world users who (rightfully) do not know complex domain
policies; or (3) the user simulation LM might have limited capacity at reasoning, calculation, long-
context memorization, or alignment with the instruction prompt, e.g., in § C.2.2 the user authorizes
the agent-recommended lamp without double checking its features. While these can all be improved
in future work, one can also argue that this is indicative of the real world where users can have a wide
range of skill sets and knowledge, and the onus is on the agents to handle diverse users.
In addition, one can also add more systematic checks to the simulator to ensure unique outcomes.
The domain policies can also be made more complex to match real-world scenarios. More evaluation
metrics can be added to define agent success (e.g., LM checks that certain rules are followed). The
manual annotation process for the benchmark is difficult and requires a deep understanding of both
the domain and agent capabilities. There is also some element of implicit bias during the task
curation process since we use the gpt-4-turbo FC agent to tune the user’s system prompt. Future
work can investigate alternative ways of using LMs for improving data curation and user simulation.
Finally, while we don’t believe this work has potential negative societal implications directly, it helps
real-world agents which can have various consequences for the economy and society in the future.
Challenges for agents. At the core, the main results from our experiments demonstrate a critical
fact: agents built on top of LM function calling lack sufficient consistency and rule-following ability
to reliably build real-world applications. Solving both of these problems can have outsized impact
on automating several real-world tasks and ensuring smoother human-in-the-loop interaction. Other
specific features to improve in agents include long-horizon information tracking and memory, as well
as the ability to focus on the right pieces of information in context for the decision at hand, especially
when there may be conflicting facts present.
